itemText= The city burned. There was no escaping it.
itemText= GenCorp, the leading chemical manufacture in the west, had been working on the project for years. They said it would extended
itemText= human lives on average of fifty years. They were right. The old started living longer, people who were fatally ill, suddenly cured.

itemText= A world without sickness and disease, weere men and women were free to enjoy the world without the fear of contracting infections. Parents
itemText= were able to watch their children, and even their grandchildren, grow old.
itemText= But something went wrong.
itemText= What they didn't realise was that X2 was highly unstable. Generations of mututions took it's toll. But how could they have known? By that
itemText= point X2 was considered such a success, the government wasn't even keeping tabs on it anymore. By the time he changes were noticed the
itemText= original scientists were long dead. And that was the problem. It wasn't affecting the living. Just the dead.
itemText= As the bodies decayed, X2 was seeping out and spreading through the soil. Ever so slowly spreading throughout the country. With each new body

itemText= longer than the men in the white coats ever imagined.
itemText= The dead started to rise.
